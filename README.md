Hi, I'm a first-year undergraduate at Rutgers University studying Electrical & Computer Engineering. My primary interest is in embedded systems and microcontrollers. I also play the saxaphone :)

Here's an overview of my work-related repositories:

1. [Bike-Project](https://github.com/Schmiff1/Bike-Project) -- Designed an LED bike light system which dynamically adjusts colors based on real-time bike speed, leveraging FastLED and ESP32 microcontrollers for seamless performance.
2. [Unreal-Twitch](https://github.com/Schmiff1/UnrealTwitch) -- Developed a backend service for a Twitch live stream extension, seamlessly integrating with Unreal Engine.
